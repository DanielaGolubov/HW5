    <p><b><big>Lorem Ipsum</big></b> is <i>simply dummy text</i> of the printing and typesetting industry.
        <mark>Lorem Ipsum</mark>
        has been the
        <br>
        industry's standard dummy text <sup>ever since the 1500s</sup>, when an unknown printer took a galley of
            type and
            scrambled <br>
        it to make a type specimen book. It has survived <b><u>not only five centuries</u></b>, but also the leap
        into
        electronic<br>
        typesetting, <del>remaining essentially unchanged</del>. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
        Letraset<br>
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and <i><b>more recently</b></i> with desktop publishing software like
        <u>Aldus
            PageMaker</u><br>
        including versions of <b><sub>Lorem Ipsum</sub></b>.
